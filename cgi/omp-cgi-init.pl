# This is not a perl program
# It's a small chunk of perl code that can be used by all OMP CGI
# scripts to determine standard environment variables and perl module
# paths.

# It is an important simplification since it means that all the CGI
# scripts can have the location of their OMP module path changed in
# one place rather than every CGI script.

# This file must be in the same directory as your CGI program.
# It can be loaded using

#     do './cgi-init.pl';

    # For taint checking, restrict our path

    use File::Spec;

    # Set the configuration directory, unless we have an override
    # from the environment
