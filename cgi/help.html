    <h1>WORF Help</h1>

<h2>What is WORF?</h2>
WORF stands for WWW Observing Remotely Facility. It is a web-based system that allows users to observe data both as it is observed and as it is reduced at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. Its homepage is <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/software/worf/">here</a>.<p>
<h2>How do I use WORF?</h2>
When you sign in with your project ID and password (if you do not have a project ID and password, please contact your support scientist), you will see a table listing the latest raw and reduced group observations for each instrument on UKIRT. If you do not see such a table, no data has been taken for the current UT date for your project.<br><br>
If you click on any "view" link, an image of the data will be displayed using default values. These values may be modified by changing the appropriate values and clicking the "modify" button. If you are modifying x- or y-axis cropping or scaling, make sure you select the proper radiobutton (beside full/crop and autoscaled/set) to allow cropping or scaling to work properly.<br><br>
If you attempt to display a spectrum as an image, WORF will automatically revert to displaying a spectrum. It is not currently possible to display a spectrum as an image, but it is possible to display an image as a spectrum by taking a cut of rows.<p>
<h2>My reduced data isn't showing up!</h2>
This may be due to a number of reasons. The reduced data will only appear when the raw data have been reduced -- if the exposure time or number of jitters is large, then a reduced group image may be slow to appear. There may be problems at the telescope which stops data from being reduced. There may be a problem with file headers -- if the project ID in the file header does not match the project ID you entered, then the data will not be displayed.<p>
<h2>How do I download data?</h2>
When you click the "download" link, you should be presented with the option to save or open the file. As a script grabs the data for you, it will probably be very unlikely that you are able to directly open the file. Instead, you should save the data to a directory on your computer (renaming the file as necessary) so you can examine it in more detail.<p>
If you have questions or problems with WORF, email <a href="mailto:b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu">Brad Cavanagh</a>. Further information (albiet relatively out-of-date) may be found <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/software/worf/paper/">here</a>.
