To Do list for the OMP SOAP Servers
===================================


MSBServer + SpServer
--------------------

 - Treat tauband and seeing as single bits of an integer        [1.0]
   to allow scheduling on "band 1+2"

MSBServer
---------

 - Query parsing (OMP::MSBQuery)                                [4.0]

 - increment "pending" allocation when MSB marked as done       [1.0]
    [needs interaction with OMP::ProjDB class]

 - Stored procedures for calculating target elevation           [5.0??10??]

SpServer
--------

 - password authentication                                      [3.0]
    [via OMP::ProjDB]

 - "fix" the MSBID generation code so that it caches the value  [1.0]
    before deleting old rows rather than querying the database
    each time an MSB is added to the DB.

ProjServer
----------

 [Effectively to write OMP::ProjDB and OMP::ProjServer]

 - implement project summary                        [1.0]
     - as XML
     - as plain text

 - implement queue summary                          [3.0]
    (all projects, projects with time remaining)


 - implement password generation + mailing          [2.0]

 - project initialisation in database               [3.0]
   [probably as method on server and a master
    password]. We need to define server methods
    for modifying project contents.

 - adjustment of time remaining                     [1.0]
