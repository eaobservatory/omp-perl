To Do list for the OMP SOAP Servers
===================================


- [possible] Reuse existing MSBID slots when resubmitting a
  science program if it has not changed at all (Only really true
  when doneMSB is used). [we probably want to disallow this to
  force people to do queries after each observation]

 - "allocated" vs "fallback" allocations
     [possibly just using tagpriority]

 - Allocation per weather band (in a system that works for
   both telescopes).

- Add proper sorting by tagpriority, internal MSB priority and possibly
  completion rate.  [also needs the tagpriority to come back from the query 
  even though that is in the project table]
  return order sorted in tagpriority order
   - allow it to be weighted by completion rate?


- Queries of the form <date delta="-1" /> should default to 
  a range of "now" and "now -1". Currently this does not work because
  the parser skips if there is no content in the element.

- Waveband code does not seem to handle significant figures properly.

- When an observation has a negative wavelength (eg a dark) it should
  not be stored in the obs table unless the MSB consists solely
  of observations with negative wavelengths. This prevents a dark
  from causing a search on wavelength to fail. Will also need
  a tweak of obscount value stored in msb table. Need to write something
  to the obs table so still have to write entries if they are the only
  entries.

- Make sure the calculation for default minel is clever enough to
  deal with sources that never rise above the min elevation 

- multi-wavelength filters are not supported at all
