To Do list for the OMP SOAP Servers
===================================


MSBServer + SpServer
--------------------

 - Treat tauband and seeing as single bits of an integer        [1.0]
   to allow scheduling on "band 1+2"

    [not required since the query is now built up as
      "band 1 or band 2"]

 - decide on whether project ID should be case sensitive
   and implement that decision.

    [implemented as case insensitive - everything is now upper cased]

MSBServer
---------

 - Query parsing (OMP::MSBQuery)                                [4.0]

    [done first pass]


 - increment "pending" allocation when MSB marked as done       [1.0]
    [needs interaction with OMP::ProjDB class]

 - Stored procedures for calculating target elevation           [5.0??10??]

    [this will be done in perl as a first test implementation.
     Should not be too onerous because we only have to test
     the first N rather than all the matches]


SpServer
--------

 - password authentication                                      [3.0]
    [via OMP::ProjDB]

 - "fix" the MSBID generation code so that it caches the value  [1.0]
    before deleting old rows rather than querying the database
    each time an MSB is added to the DB.

      [This has now been optimised so that the ID is cached
       during a store]


ProjServer
----------

 [Effectively to write OMP::ProjDB and OMP::ProjServer]

 - implement project summary                        [1.0]
     - as XML
     - as plain text

  [Done]


 - implement queue summary                          [3.0]
    (all projects, projects with time remaining)


 - implement password generation + mailing          [2.0]

 - project initialisation in database               [3.0]
   [probably as method on server and a master
    password]. We need to define server methods
    for modifying project contents.

 - adjustment of time remaining                     [1.0]
