To Do list for the OMP SOAP Servers
===================================


MSBServer + SpServer
--------------------

 - Treat tauband and seeing as single bits of an integer
   to allow scheduling on "band 1+2"

MSBServer
---------

 - Query parsing (OMP::MSBQuery)

 - increment "pending" allocation when MSB marked as done

 - Stored procedures for calculaing target elevation

SpServer
--------

 - password authentication

 - "fix" the MSBID generation code so that it caches the value
    before deleting old rows rather than querying the database
    each time an MSB is added to the DB.

ProjServer
----------

 - implement project summary
     - as XML
     - as plain text

 - implement queue summary (all projects, projects with time remaining)

 - implement password generation + mailing

 - project initialisation in database

 - adjustment of time remaining
