=head2 Accessor Methods

Instance accessor methods. Methods beginning with an underscore
are deemed to be private and do not form part of the public interface.

=over 4

=item B<refDate>

Return the date object associated with the query. If no date has been
specified explicitly in the query the current date is returned.
[although technically the "current" date is actually the date when the
query was parsed rather than the date the exact time this method was
called]

  $date = $query->refDate;

The time can not be specified as an input argument.

This allows the target availability to be calculated.

  my $self = shift;

  # Get the hash form of the query
  my $href = $self->query_hash;

  # Check for "date" key

    $date = gmtime;

    # Rebless
    bless $date, "Time::Piece::MySQL";
  }
  return $date;
}

=item B<airmass>

Return the requested airmass range as an C<OMP::Range> object.
The range can be specified as either an elevation or an airmass.
If both are specified then the smallest range that satisfies both
will be returned.

  $range = $query->airmass;

Returns C<undef> if the range has not been specified.

=cut

    # Dont worry about refraction effects (no reason
    # to add a PAL dependency here)

      next unless defined $value;
      $value = 1.0/sin($value * D2R);
      $airmass_el->$method( $value );
    }

    # Of course, an airmass has an inverted sense of range
    # from an elevation
    my ($min, $max) = $airmass_el->minmax;
    $airmass_el->minmax($max, $min);

  }

  # Now determine the final range based on both
  # airmass and elevation.
  if (defined $airmass_el) {

    } else {
      # We only had an elevation
      $airmass = $airmass_el;
    }
  }

  return $airmass;
}

=item B<ha>

Return the requested hour angle range as an C<OMP::Range> object.

  $range = $query->ha;

Returns C<undef> if the range has not been specified.
Units are assumed to be hours.

=cut

sub ha {
  my $self = shift;

  # Get the hash form of the query
  my $href = $self->query_hash;

  # Check for "airmass" key
  my $ha;
  $ha = $href->{ha} if exists $href->{ha};
  return $ha;
}

=item B<seeing>

Return the requested seeing as an C<OMP::Range> object.

  $seeing = $query->seeing;

Returns C<undef> if the seeing has not been specified. Units are
assumed to be in arcseconds.

=cut

sub seeing {
  my $self = shift;

  # Get the hash form of the query.
  my $href = $self->query_hash;

  # Check for 'P.seeingmax' key.
  my $seeing;

    $seeing = $href->{'P.seeingmax'}->min;
  }
  return $seeing;
}

=item B<tau>

Return the given tau value.

=cut

sub tau {
    my $self = shift;

    my $href = $self->raw_query_hash();

    return undef
        unless (exists $href->{'tau'})
           and (ref $href->{'tau'});

    return $href->{'tau'}->[0];
}

=item B<constraints>

Returns a hash containing the general project constraints that 
can be applied to this query.

Supported constraints are:

  observability  - is the source up
  remaining      - is the MSB still to be observed
  allocation     - has the full project allocation been used
  state          - is the project enabled
  zoa            - is the source within the zone-of-avoidance?

Each of these will have a true (constraint is active) or false
(constraint is disabled) value.

If the query includes an instruction to disable all constraints
this will be respected by setting all values to false.

Default is all values set to true.

  my %constraints = $q->constraints;

The constraints are cached (ie only calculated once per instance).

=cut

sub constraints {
  my $self = shift;

  # Check in cache
  return %{ $self->{Constraints} } if $self->{Constraints};

  # Get the query in hash form
  my $href = $self->query_hash;

  # Default values
  my %constraints = (
		     observability => 1,
		     remaining => 1,
		     allocation => 1,
		     state => 1,
                     zoa => 1,

  # Go through the disableconstraint array making a hash
  if (exists $href->{disableconstraint}) {
    for my $con (@{ $href->{disableconstraint} } ) {
      $con = lc( $con );
      # immediately drop out if we hit "all"
      if ($con eq "all" ) {
	for my $key (keys %constraints) {
	  $constraints{$key} = 0;
	}
	last;
      } elsif (exists $constraints{$con}) {
	# If it is in the allowed constraints list set to false
	$constraints{$con} = 0;
      }
    }
  }

  # Store it in cache
  $self->{Constraints} = \%constraints;

=item B<sql>

Returns an SQL representation of the MSB Query using the specified
database table.

  $sql = $query->sql( $msbtable, $obstable, $projtable, $coitable );

Returns undef if the query could not be formed.

The query includes explicit tests to make sure that time remains
on the project and that the target is available (in terms of being
above the horizon and in terms of being schedulable)

  #    that matched within each MSB. The result is stored to a temp table
  # 2. Query the temporary table to determine all the MSB's that had
  #    all their observations match and return the MSB information

  # We also DROP the temporary table immediately since sybase
  # keeps them around for until the connection is ended.

  # It is assumed that the observation information will be retrieved
  # in a subsequent query if required.

  # Get the names of the temporary tables

  # Additionally there are a number of constraints that are

  # sense for the OMP. These are:
  #  observability  - is the source up
  #  remaining      - is the MSB still to be observed
  #  allocation     - has the full project allocation been used

=begin __PRIVATE__METHODS__

=item B<_root_element>

Class method that returns the name of the XML root element to be
located in the query XML. This changes depending on whether we
are doing an MSB or Project query.
Returns "MSBQuery" by default.

=cut

sub _root_element {
  return "MSBQuery";
}

=item B<_post_process_hash>

Go through the hash creating C<OMP::Range> objects where appropriate
and fixing up known issues such as "cloud" and "moon" which used to be
treated as lower limits rather than exact matches (so there are
backwards compatibility traps in place).

  $query->_post_process_hash( \%hash );

"date" strings are converted to a date object.

"date", "tau", "sky", "moon", "cloud" and "seeing" queries are each
converted to two separate queries (one on "max" and one on "min") [but
the "date" key is retained so that the reference date can be obtained
in order to calculate source availability).

Also converts abbreviated form of project name to the full form
recognised by the database, but see below for ways of stopping this.

The current semester is used for all queries unless a semester
or a projectid is explicitly specified in the query.

Tau and seeing must be positive. If they are not positive they will be
ignored.

"timeest" fields are allowed a "units" attribute to indicate whether
the length is specified in minutes or seconds.

The "projectid" field is allowed an attribute of "full" to indicate
whether the project ID is known to be complete (1) or whether it is
abbreviated (0). In the absence of this attribute a telescope I<must>
be supplied since this is required to determine what form a particular
project ID must take. Note that you should be consistent with your
attributes in this case. The assumption will be that if "full" is true
for any project ID then it is true for all project IDs (but that may
depend on the order of the XML and should not be relied upon).

A telescope is required unless a fully expanded project ID is specified
or an explicit MSB checksum.

=head1 Query XML

The Query XML is specified as follows:

=over 4

=item B<MSBQuery>

The top-level container element is E<lt>MSBQueryE<gt>.

=item B<Equality>

Elements that contain simply C<PCDATA> are assumed to indicate
a required value.

  <instrument>SCUBA</instrument>

Would only match if C<instrument=SCUBA>.

=item B<Ranges>

Elements that contain elements C<max> and/or C<min> are used
to indicate ranges.

  <elevation><min>30</min></elevation>
  <priority><max>2</max></priority>

Why dont we just use attributes?

  <priority max="2" /> ?

Using explicit elements is probably easier to generate.

Ranges are inclusive.

=item B<Multiple matches>

Elements that contain other elements are assumed to be containing
multiple alternative matches (C<OR>ed).

  <instruments>
   <instrument>CGS4</instrument>
   <instrument>IRCAM</instrument>
  </isntruments>

C<max> and C<min> are special cases. In general the parser will
ignore the plural element (rather than trying to determine that
"instruments" is the plural of "instrument"). This leads to the
dropping of plurals such that multiple occurrence of the same element
in the query represent variants directly.

  <name>Tim</name>
  <name>Kynan</name>

would suggest that names Tim or Kynan are valid. This also means

  <instrument>SCUBA</instrument>
  <instruments>
    <instrument>CGS4</instrument>
  </instruments>

will select SCUBA or CGS4.

Neither C<min> nor C<max> can be included more than once for a
particular element. The most recent values for C<min> and C<max> will
be used. It is also illegal to use ranges inside a plural element.

=item B<Reference date>

The C<date> element can be used to specify a specific date
for the query. This date is used for determining source availability
and is compared with any date constraints for a particular MSB. If a date
is not supplied the current date is automatically inserted. The date
should be supplied in ISO format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM

  <date>2002-04-15T04:52</date>

=item B<tau, seeing, cloud, moon and sky>

Queries including tau and seeing reflect the current weather conditions
but do not correspond to an equivalent table in the database. The database
contains allowable ranges (e.g. taumin and taumax) and the supplied
value must lie within the range. Therefore for a query such as:

  <tau>0.06</tau>

the query would become

  taumin <= 0.05 AND taumax >= 0.05

=item B<target observability>

Constraints on the observability of the target are not calculated in
SQL. These must be done post-query. Methods are provided to make the
target constraints available (essentially the minimum elevation).

=item B<query constraints>

Additionally there are a number of constraints that are
always applied to the query simply because they make
sense for the OMP. These are:

 observability  - is the source up
 remaining      - is the MSB still to be observed
 allocation     - has the full project allocation been used

These constraints can be disabled individually by using
XML for example,

 <disableconstraint>observability</disableconstraint>

Any number of these elements can be included.

Alternatively all scheduling constraints can be disabled
using "all".

 <disableconstraint>all</disableconstraint>
