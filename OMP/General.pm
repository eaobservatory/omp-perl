OMP::General - general purpose methods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OMP::General;

  # To be saved with HTML markup.
  $insertstring = OMP::General->prepare_for_insert( $string );

  # Provided project id is a partial string.
  $proj = OMP::General->infer_projectid( projectid => $input,
                                         telescope => 'ukirt',
                                         semester => $sem,
                                       );

  # Get array reference of file content.
  $lines = OMP::General->get_file_contents( 'file' => '/file/path' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

General purpose routines that are not associated with any particular
class but that are useful in more than one class.

# Get round this by loading the utf8 module. Note that we solve the
# bug without contaminating our lexical namespace because the use
# line has the side effect of loading in the module that knows about
# the SWASHNEW method. Clearly crazy that the perl core can need this
# without loading it first. Fixed in perl 5.8.0. These are triggered
# because the XML parser and the web server provide UTF8 characters
# without loading associated handler code.

=head1 METHODS

There are no instance methods, only class (static) methods.

=head2 Strings

=over 4

=item B<prepare_for_insert>

Convert a text string into one that is ready to be stored in
the database.

  $insertstring = OMP::General->prepare_for_insert( $string );

This method converts the string as follows:

=over 8

=item *

Converts a single quote into the HTML entity &apos;

=item *

Converts a carriage return into <lt>br<gt>.

=item *

Strips all ^M characters.

=back

The returned string is then ready to be inserted into the database.

=cut

sub prepare_for_insert {
  my $class = shift;
  my $string = shift;

  $string =~ s/\'/\&apos;/g;
  $string =~ s/\015//g;
  $string =~ s/\n/<br>/g;

  return $string;
}

=back

=head2 Time Allocation Bands

These methods are now deprecated in favour of the C<OMP::SiteQuality>
class. Please do not use these in new code.

=over 4

=item B<determine_band>

Determine the time allocation band. This is used for scheduling
and for decrementing observing time.

  $band = OMP::General->determine_band( %details );

The band is determined from the supplied details. Recognized
keys are:

  TAU       - the current CSO tau
  TAURANGE  - OMP::Range object containing a tau range
  TELESCOPE - name of the telescope

Currently TAU or TAURANGE are only used if TELESCOPE=JCMT. In all
other cases (and if TELESCOPE is not supplied) the band returned is 0.
If TELESCOPE=JCMT either TAU or TAURANGE must be present. An exception
is thrown if neither TAU nor TAURANGE are present.

From a single tau value it is not possible to distinguish a split band
(e.g. "2*") from a "normal" band (e.g. "2"). In these cases the normal
band is always returned.

If a tau range is supplied, this method will return an array of all
bands that present in that range (including partial bands). In this
case starred bands will be recognized correctly.

=cut

sub determine_band {
  my $self = shift;
  my %details = @_;
  warnings::warnif( "OMP::General::determine_band deprecated. Use OMP::SiteQuality instead");
  return OMP::SiteQuality::determine_tauband( @_ );
}

=item B<get_band_range>

Given a band name, return the OMP::Range object that defines the band.

  $range = OMP::General->get_band_range($telescope, @bands);

If multiple bands are supplied the range will include the extreme values.
(BUG: no check is made to determine whether the bands are contiguous)

Only defined for JCMT. Returns an unbounded range (lowe limit zero) for
any other telescope.

Returns undef if the band is not known.

=cut

sub get_band_range {
  my $class = shift;
  my $tel = shift;
  my @bands = @_;
  warnings::warnif( "OMP::General::get_band_range deprecated. Use OMP::SiteQuality instead");
  return OMP::SiteQuality::get_tauband_range( $tel, @_);
}

=back

=head2 Projects

=over 4

=item B<infer_projectid>

Given a subset of a project ID attempt to determine the actual
project ID.

  $proj = OMP::General->infer_projectid( projectid => $input,
                                         telescope => 'ukirt',
                                       );

  $proj = OMP::General->infer_projectid( projectid => $input,
                                         telescope => 'ukirt',
                                         semester => $sem,
                                       );

  $proj = OMP::General->infer_projectid( projectid => $input,
                                         telescope => 'ukirt',
                                         date => $date,
                                       );

If telescope is not supplied it is guessed.  If the project ID is just
a number it is assumed to be part of a UKIRT style project. If it is a
number with a letter prefix it is assumed to be the JCMT style (ie u03
-> m01bu03) although a prefix of "s" is treated as a UKIRT service
project and expanded to "u/serv/01" (for "s1"). If the supplied ID is
ambiguous (most likely from a UH ID since both JCMT and UKIRT would
use a shortened id of "h01") the telescope must be supplied or else
the routine will croak. Japanese UKIRT programs can be abbreviated
as "j4" for "u/02b/j4". JCMT service programs can be abbreviated with
the letter "s" and the country code ("su03" maps to s02bu03, valid
prefixes are "su", "si", and "sc". Dutch service programmes can not
be abbreviated). In general JCMT service programs do not really benefit
from abbreviations since in most cases the current semester is not
appropriate.

The semester is determined from a "semester" key directly or from a date.
The current date is used if no date or semester is supplied.
The supplied date must be a C<Time::Piece> object.

Finally, if the number is prefixed by more than one letter
(with the exception of s[uic] reserved for JCMT service) it is
assumed to indicate a special ID (usually reserved for support
scientists) that is not telescope specific (although be aware that
the Observing Tool can not mix telescopes in a single science
program even though the rest of the OMP could do it). The only
translation occuring in these cases is to pad the digit to two
characters.

If a project id consists entirely of alphabetic characters it
will be returned without modification.

=item B<extract_projectid>

Given a string (for example a full project id or possibly a subject
line of a mail message) attempt to extract a string that looks like
a OMP project ID.

  $projectid = OMP::General->extract_projectid( $string );

Returns undef if nothing looking like a project ID could be located.
The match is done on word boundaries.

No attempt is made to verify that this project ID is actually
in the OMP system.

Note that this method has the side effect of untainting the
supplied variable.

=head2 Telescopes

=over 4

=item B<determine_tel>

Return the telescope name to use in the current environment.
This is usally obtained from the config system but if the config
system returns a choice of telescopes a Tk window will popup
requesting that the specific telescope be chosen.

If no Tk window reference is supplied, and multiple telescopes
are available, returns all the telescopes (either as a list
in list context or an array ref in scalar context). ie, if called
with a Tk widget, guarantees to return a single telescope, if called
without a Tk widget is identical to querying the config system directly.

  $tel = OMP::General->determine_tel( $MW );

Returns undef if the user presses the "cancel" button when prompted
for a telescope selection.

If a Term::ReadLine object is provided, the routine will prompt for
a telescope if there is a choice. This has the same behaviour as for the
Tk option. Returns undef if the telescope was not valid after a prompt.

See if the user ID can be guessed from the system environment
without asking for it.

Uses the C<$USER> environment variable for the first guess. If that
is not available or is not verified as a valid user the method either
returns C<undef> or, if the optional widget object is supplied,
popups up a Tk dialog box requesting input from the user.

If the userid supplied via the widget is still not valid, give
up and return undef.

=item B<log_level>

Control which log messages are written to the log file.

  $current = OMP::General->log_level();
  OMP::General->log_level( &OMP__LOG_DEBUG );
  OMP::General->log_level( "DEBUG" );

The constants are defined in OMP::Constants. Currently supported
logging levels are:

  IMPORTANT   (only important messages)
  INFO        (informational and important messages)
  DEBUG       (debugging, info and important messages)

The level can be set using the above strings as well as the actual
constants, but constants will be returned if the level is requested.
If the new level is not recognized, the existing level will be retained.

Note that WARNING and ERROR log messages are always written to the log
and can not be disabled individually.

The default log level is INFO (ie no DEBUG messages) but can be over-ridden
by defining the environment OMP_LOG_LEVEL to one of "IMPORTANT", "INFO" or
"DEBUG"

=item B<log_message>

Log general information to a file. Each message can be associated with
a particular importance or severity such that a particular log message
will only be written to the log file if that particular level of
logging is enabled (which can be set via the C<log_level>
method). WARNING and ERROR log messages will always be written.

By default, all messages are treated as "INFO" messages if no log
level is specified.

  OMP::General->log_message( $message );

If a second argument is provided, it specifies the log
severity/importance level. Constants are available from
C<OMP::Constants>.

  OMP::General->log_message( $message, OMP__LOG_DEBUG );

The currently defined set are:

  ERROR     - an error message
  WARNING   - a warning message
  IMPORTANT - important log message (always written)
  INFO      - general information
  DEBUG     - verbose logging

The log file is opened for append (with a lock), the message is written
and the file is closed. The message is augmented with details of the
hostname, the process ID and the date.

Fails silently if the file can not be opened (rather than cause the whole
system to stop because it is not being written).

Uses the config C<logdir> entry to determine the required logging
directory but will fall back to C</tmp/ompLogs> if the required
directory can not be written to. A new file is created for each UT day.
The directory is created if it does not exist.

Returns immediately if the environment variable C<$OMP_NOLOG> is set,
even if the message has been tagged ERROR [maybe it should always send
error messages to STDERR if the process is attached to a terminal?].
