TSS movement, etc.)

=cut

use constant OMP__TIMEGAP_LOGISTICS => 19;

=item OMP__TIMEGAP_UNKNOWN

Flags a timegap as being caused by unknown reasons.

=head1 TAGS

Individual sets of constants can be imported by 
including the module with tags. For example:

  use OMP::Constants qw/:status/;

will import all constants associated with OMP status checking.

The available tags are:

=over 4

=item :all

Import all constants.

=item :status

Constants associated with OMP status checking: OMP__OK and OMP__ERROR.

=item :fb

Constants associated with the feedback system.

=item :done

Constants associated with the MSB done table.

=item :msb

Constants associated with MSBs.

=item :obs

Constants associated with observation statuses.

=item :timegap

Constants associated with time gaps.

=item :logging

Constants associated the logging system.

=back

=head1 USAGE

The constants can be used as if they are subroutines.
For example, if I want to print the value of OMP__ERROR I can

  use OMP::Constants;
  print OMP__ERROR;

or

  use OMP::Constants ();
  print OMP::Constants::OMP__ERROR;
