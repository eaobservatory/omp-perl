=head1 NAME

OMP::UserQuery - Class representing an XML OMP query of the user database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $query = new OMP::UserQuery( XML => $xml );
  $sql = $query->sql( $usertable );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class can be used to process OMP user queries.
The queries are usually represented as XML.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<sql>

Returns an SQL representation of the XML Query using the specified
database table.

  $sql = $query->sql( $usertable );

Returns undef if the query could not be formed.

The SQL returned by this query will include an entry for each response
that matches (in the joined fault and response table).  This needs to
be the case since a query on date or author must include the fault
response table but it is therefore possible to match partial
faults. In order to overcome this and to obtain a full fault
(including responses) the data returned by the query must be sifted
for fault IDs and the responses must be retrieved by additional
queries to the response table. [we could of course create a temporary
table with just the faultids and then do an internal query that
gets all the faults with that faultid]

=cut

sub sql {
  my $self = shift;

  throw OMP::Error::DBMalformedQuery("sql method invoked with incorrect number of arguments\n")
    unless scalar(@_) ==1;

  my ($usertable) = @_;

  # Generate the WHERE clause from the query hash
  my $subsql = $self->_qhash_tosql();

  # If the resulting query contained anything we should prepend
  # an AND so that it fits in with the rest of the SQL. This allows
  # an empty query to work without having a naked "WHERE".
  $subsql = " WHERE " . $subsql if $subsql;

  # Now need to put this SQL into the template query
  my $sql = " SELECT * FROM $usertable U $subsql ORDER BY userid";

  return "$sql\n";

}

=begin __PRIVATE__METHODS__

=item B<_root_element>

Class method that returns the name of the XML root element to be
located in the query XML. This changes depending on whether we
are doing an MSB or Project query.
Returns "FaultQuery" by default.

=cut

sub _root_element {
  return "UserQuery";
}

=item B<_post_process_hash>

Do table specific post processing of the query hash. For projects this
mainly entails converting range hashes to C<OMP::Range> objects (via
the base class), upcasing some entries and converting "status" fields
to queries on "remaining" and "pending" columns.

  $query->_post_process_hash( \%hash );

Also converts abbreviated form of project name to the full form
recognised by the database (this is why a telescope is required).

=cut

sub _post_process_hash {
  my $self = shift;
  my $href = shift;

  # Do the generic pre-processing
  $self->SUPER::_post_process_hash( $href );

  # Loop over each key
  for my $key (keys %$href ) {
    # Skip private keys
    next if $key =~ /^_/;

    # Nothing yet

  }

  # Case sensitivity
  # If we are dealing with a these we should make sure we upper
  # case them (more efficient to upper case everything than to do a
  # query that ignores case)
  $self->_process_elements($href, sub { uc(shift) },
                           [qw/ userid alias /]);


  # These entries have a different column name in the table,
  # so replace them with the actual column name
  for (qw/ name /) {
    if (exists $href->{$_}) {
      my $key = "u".$_;
      $href->{$key} = $href->{$_};
      delete $href->{$_};
    }
  }

  # Remove attributes since we dont need them anymore
  delete $href->{_attr};

}

=head1 Query XML

The Query XML is specified as follows:

=over 4

=item B<UserQuery>

The top-level container element is E<lt>FaultQueryE<gt>.

=item B<Equality>

Elements that contain simply C<PCDATA> are assumed to indicate
a required value.

  <instrument>SCUBA</instrument>

Would only match if C<instrument=SCUBA>.

=item B<Ranges>

Elements that contain elements C<max> and/or C<min> are used
to indicate ranges.

  <elevation><min>30</min></elevation>
  <priority><max>2</max></priority>

Why dont we just use attributes?

  <priority max="2" /> ?

Using explicit elements is probably easier to generate.

Ranges are inclusive.

=item B<Multiple matches>

Elements that contain other elements are assumed to be containing
multiple alternative matches (C<OR>ed).

  <instruments>
   <instrument>CGS4</instrument>
   <instrument>IRCAM</instrument>
  </isntruments>

C<max> and C<min> are special cases. In general the parser will
ignore the plural element (rather than trying to determine that
"instruments" is the plural of "instrument"). This leads to the
dropping of plurals such that multiple occurrence of the same element
in the query represent variants directly.

  <name>Tim</name>
  <name>Kynan</name>

would suggest that names Tim or Kynan are valid. This also means

  <instrument>SCUBA</instrument>
  <instruments>
    <instrument>CGS4</instrument>
  </instruments>

will select SCUBA or CGS4.

Neither C<min> nor C<max> can be included more than once for a
particular element. The most recent values for C<min> and C<max> will
be used. It is also illegal to use ranges inside a plural element.
