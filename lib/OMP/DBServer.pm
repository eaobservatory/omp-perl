=head1 NAME

OMP::DBServer - Base class for servers that talk to the OMP database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use base qw/OMP::DBServer/;

    $db = $class->dbConnection;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class should be used as a base class for handling generic
method relating to the OMP database required by the OMP servers.

Currently, this just provides a method for providing the database
connection object.

use 5.006;
use strict;
use warnings;

use OMP::DBbackend;

our $VERSION = '2.000';

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<dbConnection>

The database connection object. This is called by all the methods
that use a C<OMP::MSBDB> object. The connection is automatically
instantiated the first time it is requested.

Returns a connection object of type C<OMP::DBbackend>.

{
    # Hide the lexical variable
    my $db;

    sub dbConnection {
        my $class = shift;

        if (defined $db) {
            return $db;
        }
        else {
            $db = OMP::DBbackend->new;
            return $db;
        }
    }
}

=head1 NOTES

This is probably a design flaw but as the system has evolved the
caching of the database connection has worked for the generic
server interfaces but all the DB classes can be independently
instantiated with their own DB connection object which subverts
the caching since OMP::DBbackend is called directly. This is partly
my fault because I did not publicise the

    OMP::DBServer->dbConnection()

interface enough and everyone used the DBbackend connection. Too
late to change this now so OMP::DBbackend now also does connection
caching. If someone is feeling really keen they could remove
all the DBbackend references from the code....
