=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OMP::User;

  $u = new OMP::User( userid => 'xyz',
                      name => 'Mr Z',
                      email => 'xyz@abc.def.com');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

of an user of the OMP system.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new C<OMP::User> object.

  $u = new OMP::User( %details );

The initial state of the object can be configured by passing in a hash
with keys: "userid", "email", "alias", "cadcuser" and "name". See the
associated accessor methods for details.

Returns C<undef> if an object can not be created or configured.

  # Read the arguments

      return undef if (!defined $retval && defined $args{$key});
    }
  }

  return $user;
}

=item B<extract_user>

Attempt to extract a OMP::User object from an email
"From:" line or from a HTML hyperlink. This is simply
a thin layer above B<extract_user_from_email> and
B<extract_user_from_href>. The method tries to
determine which method would be best to use.

  $user = OMP::User->extract_user( $string );

Returns undef if no user information could be extracted.

=cut

sub extract_user {
  my $class = shift;
  my $string = shift;

  # First see if we have a mailto
  my $result;
  if ($string =~ /mailto:/) {
    # looks like HTML
    $result = $class->extract_user_from_href( $string );
  } elsif ($string =~ /@/) {
    # Looks like an email
    $result = $class->extract_user_from_email( $string );
  }

  return $result;

}

=item B<extract_user_from_email>

Attempt to extract a OMP::User object from an email
"From:" line. Assumes the email information is of the
form

   Name Label <x@a.b.c>

If there is no "comment" attached to the email address itself the text
before the @ will be treated as a full name if it contains a dot. If
no name comment is available and the email address itself does not
look like a I.Surname then this method returns undef (the alternative
is to return simply an object with an email address but that does not
seem to be useful). Also returns undef if a valid user ID can not be
inferred from the name.

  $user = OMP::User->extract_user_from_email( $email_string );

Even though this method is technically a constructor it is not called
directly from the normal constructor because it is forced to guess the
user ID.

If a second argument is given, then it should be a scalar reference
to which the extracted email address will be writted.  This allows
the method to return an email address in the event of failure to find
an name and thus to infer the OMP user ID.

  my $addr;
  OMP::User->extract_user_from_email($email_string, \$addr);

=cut

sub extract_user_from_email {
  my $class = shift;

  my $string = shift;
  my $addr_ref = shift;

  # Look for  "Name <addr>"
  # [^>] matches any character that is not a ">"
  # This allows us to get all the characters in an email
  # address without having to list every single acceptable
  # character. The presence of a closing ">" is all that matters.
  my ($name, $email);
  if ($string =~ /^\s*([^<]+)\s*<([^>]+)>/) {
    $name = $1;
    $email = $2;

    # Remove trailing spaces and compress spaces
    $name = _clean_string( $name );
    $email = _clean_string( $email );

  } elsif ($string =~ /^\s*<?([^>]+)>?/) {
    $email = $1;

    # Get the to from the email address
    my ($to, $domain) = split(/@/,$email);

    # Treat it as a name if it includes a dot (e.g. t.jenness@jach)
    $name = $to if $to =~ /\./;
  }

  # Did we get a scalar reference to which we can write the
  # extracted email adddress?
  $$addr_ref = $email if 'SCALAR' eq ref $addr_ref;

  # do not continue if we have no name
  return undef unless defined $name;

  # Attempt to get user id
  my $userid = $class->infer_userid( $name );

  return undef unless defined $userid;

  # Form a valid object
  return $class->new( name => $name,
                      userid => $userid,
                      email => $email);

}

=item B<extract_user_from_href>

Similar to C<extract_user_from_email> except that this method
looks for names and emails in an HTML format hyperlink:

  <a href="mailto:email">Name</a>

If "Name" above happens to also be "email" the non-domain
part of the email address is used to construct the name if
it contains a dot. If it does not contain a dot this method
returns undef. If the "Name" includes an "@" but is not the
same as the mailto email address, also returns undef since
the email addresses must be the same.

  $user = OMP::User->extract_user_from_href( $text );

=cut

sub extract_user_from_href {
  my $class = shift;
  my $string = shift;

  # Try to get the mail to and the name

    $email = $1;
    $name = $2;

    # clean the string
    $name = _clean_string( $name );
    $email = _clean_string( $email );
  } else {
    return undef;
  }

  # Is the email the same as the name?
  if ($email eq $name) {
    my ($id,$domain) = split(/@/, $name);
    $name = $id if $id =~ /\./;

  } elsif ($name =~ /@/) {
    # we have an email address in the name field
    # but it does not match the actual email address
    $name = undef;
  }

  return undef unless defined $name;

  # Attempt to get user id
  my $userid = $class->infer_userid( $name );

  return undef unless defined $userid;

  # Form a valid object

tables. All entries are compared.

field where an email is being sent via flex.  This appends
"(via flex)" to the name and gives flex's email address.

=item B<infer_userid>

Try to guess the user ID from the name. The name can either
be supplied as an argument or from within the object.

This method can be called either as a class or instance method.

  $guess = OMP::User->infer_userid( 'T Jenness' );
  $guess = $user->infer_userid;

Although the latter is only interesting if used to raise
warnings about inconsistent IDs (which is generally not enforced)
or after creating an object and making an inspired guess from the
name. The userid in the object is not updated via this method.

The guess work assumes that the name is "forname surname" (although
"F.Surname" is also okay) or alternatively "surname, forname". A
simplistic attempt is made to catch "Jr" and "Sr" as well as common
prefixes such as "Mr", "Prof" and "Dr". Also, "van", "van der", "le"
and "de" are treated as part of the surname (e.g. "U le Guin" would be
"LEGUINU").

Returns undef if a user ID could not be guessed.
