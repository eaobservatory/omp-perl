=head1 NAME

OMP::CGIPage::PkgData - Routines to help web serving of data packaging

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OMP::CGIPage::PkgData;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

General routines required to create a web page for packaging
OMP data files for the PI. Note that JCMT data retrieval requests
are optionally routed through CADC.

These functions write the web page.

Request the UT date of interest and/or package the data
and serve it. Will use CADC if the configuration for this telescope
requests it.

If inccal is not specified it defaults to true.
