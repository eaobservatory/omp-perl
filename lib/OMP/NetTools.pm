=head1 NAME

OMP::NetTools - Methods related to networking, host, etc.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OMP::NetTools;

    $local = OMP::NetTools->is_host_local();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NetTools routines that are not associated with any particular class
but that are useful in more than one class.

# In some random cases with perl 5.6.1 (and possibly 5.6.0) we get
# errors such as:
#   Can't locate object method "SWASHNEW" via package "utf8"
#              (perhaps you forgot to load "utf8"?)
# Get round this by loading the utf8 module. Note that we solve the
# bug without contaminating our lexical namespace because the use
# line has the side effect of loading in the module that knows about
# the SWASHNEW method. Clearly crazy that the perl core can need this
# without loading it first. Fixed in perl 5.8.0. These are triggered
# because the XML parser and the web server provide UTF8 characters
# without loading associated handler code.
if ($] >= 5.006 && $] < 5.008) {
  eval "use utf8;";

=head1 METHODS

There are no instance methods, only class (static) methods.

=over 4

=item B<determine_host>

Determine the host and user name of the person either running this
task. This is either determined by using the CGI environment variables
(REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_USER) or, if they are not set, the current
host running the program and the associated user name.

    ($user, $host, $email) = OMP::NetTools->determine_host;

The user name is not always available (especially if running from
CGI).  The email address is simply determined as C<$user@$host> and is
identical to the host name if no user name is determined.

An optional argument can be used to disable remote host checking
for CGI. If true, this method will return the host on which
the program is running rather than the remote host information.

    ($user, $localhost, $email) = OMP::NetTools->determine_host(1);

If the environment variable C<$OMP_NOGETHOST> is set this method will
return a hostname of "localhost" if we are not running in a CGI
context, or the straight IP address if we are. This is used when no
network connection is available and you do not wish to wait for a
timeout from C<gethostbyname>.

=item B<is_host_local>

Returns true if the host accessing this page is local, false
if not. The definition of "local" means that either there are
no dots in the domainname (eg "lapaki" or "ulu") or the domain
includes one of the endings specified in the "localdomain" config
setting.

    print "local" if OMP::NetTools->is_host_local

Usually only relevant for CGI scripts where REMOTE_ADDR is
used.
