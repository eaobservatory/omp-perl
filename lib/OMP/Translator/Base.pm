=head1 NAME

OMP::Translator::Base - translate science program to sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

**  need update

  use OMP::Translator::Base;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

**  need update

This class converts a science program object (an C<OMP::SciProg>)
into a sequence understood by the data acquisition system.

For ACSIS and SCUBA-2, XML configuration files are generated.

The actual translation is done in a subclass. The top level class
determines the correct class to use for the MSB and delegates the
translation of each observation within the MSB to that class.

=item <PosAngRot>

Rotate coordinates through a specified position angle.
Position Angle is defined as "East of North". This means
that the rotation angle is a reverse of the normal mathematical definition
of "North of East"

          N
          ^
          |
          |
    E <---+

In the above diagram (usually RA/Dec) the position angle will be
positive anti-clockwise.

  ($x2, $y2) = OMP::Translator::Base->PosAngRot( $x1, $y1, $PA );

where PA is given in degrees and not radians (mainly because
the Science Program rotation angles are all given in degrees).

Note that this routine should really be in some generic Math::
or Coords:: class. Note also that this is a class method to
facilitate use in subclasses.

After rotation, the accuracy is limited to two decimal places.

  my $self = shift;
  my ($x1, $y1, $pa) = @_;

  # New coordinates
  my ($x2,$y2);

  # Do rotation if rotation is nonzero (since in most cases
  # people do not ask for rotated coordinates) - this is
  # a very minor optimization compared two the multiple sprintfs!!
  if (abs($pa) > 0.0) {

    # Convert to radians
    my $rpa = $pa * DEG2RAD;

    # Precompute the cos and sin since we use it twice
    my $cosrpa = cos( $rpa );
    my $sinrpa = sin( $rpa );

    # Rotate to new frame
    $x2 =   $x1 * $cosrpa  +  $y1 * $sinrpa;
    $y2 = - $x1 * $sinrpa  +  $y1 * $cosrpa;

  } else {
    $x2 = $x1;
    $y2 = $y1;
  }

  # Now format to 2dp
  my $f = '%.2f';
  $x2 = sprintf($f,$x2);
  $y2 = sprintf($f,$y2);

  # trap -0.00 by formatting a negative zero
  # This is more convoluted a check because the format is variable

  $y2 = sprintf($f,0.0) if $y2 eq sprintf($f,-0.0);

  return ($x2, $y2);
}

=item B<PruneMSBs>

Remove MSBs that should not be translated. Currently, removes
MSBs that are marked as REMOVED unless there is only one MSB
supplied.

  @pruned = OMP::Translator::Base->PruneMSBs( @msbs );

Arguments are C<OMP::MSB> objects.

=cut

sub PruneMSBs {
  my $class = shift;
  my @msbs = @_;

  my @out;
  if (scalar(@msbs) > 1) {
    @out = grep { $_->remaining != OMP__MSB_REMOVED } @msbs;
  } else {
    @out = @msbs;
  }
  return @out;
}

=item B<correct_offsets>

For some observing modes, the offset iterator should not generate a set
of standalone observations, but should generate a single observation
that itself iterates over the offsets.

This routine can be used to correct the structure of the MSB such that
when it is unrolled, the named observing modes will see a set of offsets
rather than a single offset.

The name of the affected observing modes can be specified (the "obstype"
setting, ie drop the SpIter and trailing Obs).

  OMP::Translator::Base->correct_offsets( $msb, "Stare", "Jiggle" );

The MSB is modified inplace.

Problems can be encountered by this routine if there is more than one
observing type below each Offset iterator. Since this is unusual in
practice and extremely difficult to get correct (since you have to
account for all structures below the iterator) we should croak in this
situation. Currently we let it go.

=cut

sub correct_offsets {
  my $self = shift;
  my $msb = shift;
  my @obstypes = @_;

  # Note that this returns references to each observation summary.
  # We can modify this hash in place without putting the structure
  # back into the object. This will trigger a nice bug if the obssum
  # method is changed to return a copy.
  my @obs = $msb->obssum;

  # Pattern match
  my $patt = "SpIter(" . join( "|", @obstypes) . ")Obs";

    my $hastype;
    for my $type (@obstypes) {
      $hastype = 1 if exists $modes{$type};
    }
    next unless $hastype;

    # Now need to recurse through the data structure changing
    # offset iterator to a single array rather than an array

=item B<correct_wplate>
