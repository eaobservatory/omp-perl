=item B<getComments>

Return comments associated with the specified project.  With just the
project ID and password given this method will default to returning all
comments.  The third argument should be an array reference containing the
desired status types of the comments to be returned.  Status types are
defined in C<OMP::Constants>.  Final argument is optional and should be
either 'ascending' or 'descending' depending on the order in which you
want the comments to come back.

    OMP::FBServer->getComments( $project, $password, \@status, [$order]);

  $class->throwException( $E ) if defined $E;

  return $commentref;
}

=item B<alterStatus>

Requires an admin password. Last argument should be a feedback constant
as defined in C<OMP::Constants>.

Does not return anything, but will throw an error if it fails to alter
the status.

  OMP::FBServer->alterStatus( $commentid, $adminpass, $status );

                                  DB => $class->dbConnection, );

    $db->alterStatus( $commentid, $status );

  } catch OMP::Error with {
