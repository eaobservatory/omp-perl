=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

The constructor takes an XML representation of the science
program as argument and returns a new object.

                $sp = new OMP::SciProg( XML => $xml );

                $sp = new OMP::SciProg( FILE => $xmlfile );

The argument hash can either refer to an XML string or
an XML file. If neither is supplied no object will be
instantiated. If both C<XML> and C<FILE> keys exist, the
C<XML> key takes priority.

The science program is checked for well formedness and its validity
against the DTD. Throws an SpBadStructure exception if the science
program is neither valid nor well-formed.

  } else {

    return undef;
  }

  # ************** KLUGE **********************
  # Namespace issues with XML::LibXML libxml2 2.5.11. If it finds
  # xmlns="" it does not import into the default namespace (seemingly)
  # unless written as xmlns:="". This may be a problem with my
  # understanding of the problem. Should test with v2.6 when supported.
  # For now kluge it by putting in the colon
  #$xml =~ s/xmlns=/xmlns:=/;

  # so until we upgrade mauiola we need to remove the line completely
  # Use non-greedy match

           };

  # and create the object
  bless $sp, $class;

  # Since it is possible for some one to attempt to write this
  # science program to disk without needing the MSBs and since
  # the MSB finding can change the form of the Science Program
  # by consolidating identical MSBs to a single MSB we need to make
  # sure that the consolidation is triggered immediately

=head2 Accessor Methods

Instance accessor methods. Methods beginning with an underscore
are deemed to be private and do not form part of the publi interface.

=over 4

=item B<projectID>

Returns the project ID associated with this science program.

  $projectid = $sp->projectID;

Modifying the project ID, modifies the underlying DOM tree
but only the 'projectID' tag in the document root. If no
'projectID' node is found in the root, one is added.

=cut

sub projectID {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    $self->{ProjectID} = uc(shift);

    # Fix the DOM tree.
    # Need to rationalise this so that we have a method for getting
    # an element from the node tree and a method for setting a value
    # and retrieving a value. Too much repeated code otherwise
    # This code is shared with find_projectid
    my ($el) = $self->_tree->findnodes( './/projectID[1]');

    # Note that we do not look for 'project' in an SpMSB.
    # If we have no element, need to make one
    if (! defined $el) {
      # Look up the root and create a new element
      my ($root) = $self->_tree->findnodes('.//SpProg');
      my $nodename = 'projectID';

      # There is a chance that we have simply a bare SpObs
      unless (defined $root) {
        ($root) = $self->_tree->findnodes('.//SpObs');
        # So that we do not have trouble later on we do not want to insert 
        # a 'projectID' node into the SpObs since that matches a method name
        # in the recursive node traversal
        $nodename = 'project';
      }

      throw OMP::Error::SpBadStructure("Error obtaining root node in projectID discovery")

    }

  } else {
    $self->find_projectid unless defined $self->{ProjectID};
  }
  return $self->{ProjectID};
}

=item B<ot_version>

The version of the OT that was used to generate this science programme.

Read-only. Returns C<undef> if no version is available.

=cut

sub ot_version {
  my $self = shift;
  my @nodes = $self->_tree->findnodes('.//ot_version');
  if (defined $nodes[-1]) {
    my $ver = $nodes[-1]->getFirstChild->toString;
    # Clean it.
    $ver =~ s/-//g;

    return $ver;
  }
  # return explicit undef rather than empty list
  return undef;
}

=item B<telescope>

The telescope ID associated with this science programme.
Returns C<undef> if no telescope name is available (which should
be the case for OT versions older than 20040914).

This is a read-only parameter.

=cut

sub telescope {
  my $self = shift;
  my @nodes = $self->_tree->findnodes('.//telescope');
  if (defined $nodes[-1]) {
    # loop until we get a child
    for my $n (@nodes) {
      my $child = $n->getFirstChild;
      next unless defined $child;
      my $tel = uc($child->toString);
      return $tel;
    }
  }
  # return explicit undef rather than empty list
  return undef;
}

=item B<msb>

Return the C<OMP::MSB> objects associated with this science program.

  @msbs = $sp->msb;

If no MSBs are stored we automatically go and look for them using
C<locate_msbs()>.

=cut

sub msb {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    @{ $self->{MSBS} } = @_; 
  } else {
    # check to see if we have something
    unless (@{$self->{MSBS}}) {
      $self->locate_msbs;
    }
  }
  return @{ $self->{MSBS} };
}

=item B<refs>

Return a hash (reference) containing all the XML elements that
have ID tags. The hash keys are the ID attribute values (since these
are unique for a given science program). The XML is represented
by parse trees.

  $hashref = $sp->refs;
  %refs = $sp->refs;

Returns a hash reference in scalar context, a hash in list context.
The object can be populated by using a hash argument.

  $sp->refs( %refs );

The values in the hash are not checked (so we do not enforce
object type).

If no keys are stored we automatically run C<locate_refs>.

=cut

sub refs {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    %{ $self->{REFS} } = @_; 
  } else {
    # If people are asking for the refs we want to find them
    # if we havent already got them.
    unless (keys %{$self->{REFS}}) {
      # Only do this if we havent got anything in the hash
      $self->locate_refs;
    }
  }

  # Return the correct thing for the context
  if (wantarray() ) {
    return %{ $self->{REFS} };
  } else {
    return $self->{REFS};
  }
}

=item B<_parser>

Retrieves or sets the underlying XML parser object.

=cut

sub _parser {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Parser} = shift; }
  return $self->{Parser};
}


=item B<_tree>

Retrieves or sets the base of the document tree associated
with the science program. In general this is DOM based. The
interface does not guarantee the underlying object type
since that relies on the choice of XML parser.

=cut

sub _tree {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Tree} = shift; }
  return $self->{Tree};
}

=item B<timestamp>

Set or retrieve a timestamp associated with the science program.
In general this is the timestamp of the science program most
recently written to disk in the database. The XML representation
is updated if the timestamp is updated.

Returns undef if the science program has never been stored.

=cut

sub timestamp {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $timestamp = shift;
    $self->_tree->documentElement->setAttribute( "timestamp", $timestamp );
  }
  return $self->_tree->documentElement->getAttribute( "timestamp" );
}

=back

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<summary>

Summarize the science program. This can be in many forms. For example,
in the form of an XML string containing summaries of all the MSBs, or
as an array of text where each line is an ASCII summary of each MSB
(the first line of which is the column names).

An optional argument can be used to switch modes explicitly and to access
different forms of summaries. Allowed values are:

  'xml'         XML summary (equivalent to default scalar context)
  'html'        HTML summary of program
  'htmlcgi'     HTML summary of program with an 'Add Comment' button
  'asciiarray'  Array of MSB summaries in plain text (default in list context)
  'data'        Perl data structure containing an array of hashes.
                One for each MSB. Additionally, observation information
                is in another array of hashes within each MSB hash.
                Respects calling context returning a ref in scalar context.
  'objects'     Returns MSBs as array of OMP::Info::MSB objects
  'ascii'       Plain text summary of the Science Program.
                Returns a list of lines in list context. A block of text
                in scalar context.

The 'asciiarray' mode, which is the default, will not return any
information that requires astrometry to be performed.

The XML summary is of the form

  <SpProgSummary timestamp="9999999" projectid="M01BXXX">
    <SpMSBSummary>
      ...
    </SpMSBSummary>
    <SpMSBSummary>
      ...
    </SpMSBSummary>

  </SpProgSummary>

=item B<find_projectid>

Determine the project ID of the science program and store the information
in the object.

Automatically invoked by the C<projectID()> method the first time
that method is invoked.

If C<projectID> can not be found this method looks for an
element called "project" since that is placed in observations
by the OMP system. This usually occurs when an observation has
been extracted from a full science program.

If no project can be extracted, "UNKNOWN" is chosen rather
than throwing an exception.

This method forces an upper-cased version of the project ID
to be written to the DOM tree itself in the correct place
(even if that project was read from an MSB child).

=cut

sub find_projectid {
  my $self = shift;

  my ($element) = $self->_tree->findnodes('.//projectID[1]');

  # projectID element contains PCData that is the actual project ID
  if (defined $element) {

    # uppercased version
    $self->projectID( $element->getFirstChild->toString );
  } else {

    # which has been added automatically by the OMP

    }
  }

}

=item B<fetchMSB>

Given a checksum, search through the science program for a matching
MSB.

  $msb = $sp->fetchMSB( $checksum );

The MSB is returned as an OMP::MSB object. Returns C<undef> on error.

Given a checksum, determine whether that MSB is present in the science program.
Returns a boolean.

  }

    }
  }
  return 0;
}

=item B<locate_msbs>

Find the MSBs within a science program and store references
to them.

  $sp->locate_msbs

Usually called during object initialisation. Use the C<msb()> method
to retrieve the MSB objects

MSBs are indicated by either C<SpMSB> elements or lone C<SpObs> elements.

Duplicate MSBs (i.e. those that do exactly the same thing) are consolidated
into a single MSB by determining the total count and then removing
all but the first MSB from the tree.

=item B<stringify>

Convert the Science Program object into XML.

  $xml = $sp->stringify;

This method is also invoked via a stringification overload.

  print "$sp";

=cut

sub stringify {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->_tree->toString;
}

=item B<verifyMSBs>

Verify that each of the constituent MSBs is okay (as defined
by the C<verifyMSB> method in C<OMP::MSB> class).

Returns a status and a string describing any problems.

  ($status, $reason) = $msb->verifyMSBs;

Allowed status values are:

  0 - everything okay
  1 - some warnings were raised
  2 - fatal error

Note that fatal errors will probably have been caught during the
initial pass. This method does not attempt to check instrumental
specific problems.

If you receive a fatal error, you would normally want to throw
an explicit exception.

=cut

sub verifyMSBs {
  my $self = shift;

  # Assume good status
  my $status = 0;

  # Loop over the MSBs
  my $count = 0;
  my $string = '';
  for my $msb ($self->msb) {
    $count++;
    my ($msbstatus, $msbstring) = $msb->verifyMSB;
    next if $msbstatus == 0;

    # Raise status if required
    $status = $msbstatus if $status < $msbstatus;

    # Cache the string and indicate the MSB number
    $string .= "MSB $count: $msbstring\n";

  }

  return ($status, $string);
}

=item B<dupMSB>

Duplicate the supplied MSB (that must be present in the science program),
and insert it into the science program whilst retaining the original
MSB. Returns the duplicated MSB.

  $new = $sp->cloneMSB( $old );

No template replacement is used. The title of the MSB will be modified
in order to differentiate it from the original.

The MSB objects will be regenerated by this routine (so the original
object will no longer be valid either).

=cut

sub dupMSB {
  my $self = shift;
  my $msb = shift;

  return unless defined $msb;

  # Clone this MSB
  my $new = $msb->clone;
  $new->_tree->unbindNode;

  # Set the new title
  my $title = $msb->msbtitle;

  # make sure we get something new so that we can guarantee a unique checksum
  my %titles;
  for my $m ($self->msb) {
    $titles{$m->msbtitle}++;
  }
  my $tc = 1;
  my $newtitle = $title;
  while ( exists $titles{$newtitle} ) {
    $newtitle = "Copy $tc of $title";
    $tc++;
  }
  $new->msbtitle( $newtitle );

  # Find the checksum
  my $checksum = $new->checksum;

  # Insert it into the science program after the original
  $msb->_tree->parentNode->insertAfter($new->_tree, $msb->_tree);

  # Update the science program
  $self->locate_msbs;

  # Now look for the new MSB
  my @newmsbs = $self->msb;

  for my $m ($self->msb) {
    return $m if $m->checksum eq $checksum;
  }
  return;
}

=item B<removeMSB>

Remove the supplied MSB (as a C<OMP::MSB> object, previously returned
by the C<msb()> method) from the current science program. The MSBs
within the science program are recalculated.

  $sp->removeMSB( $msb );

Any previously cached MSB objects should be retrieved again from the
science program after executing this command.

May not work correctly for MSBs that have been cloned by a survey
container.

=cut

sub removeMSB {
  my $self = shift;
  my $msb = shift;

  if (UNIVERSAL::isa( $msb, "OMP::MSB")) {
    # remove it
    my $tree = $msb->_tree;
    return 0 unless defined $tree;
    $tree->unbindNode;
    $self->locate_msbs;
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

=item B<cloneMSBs>

Go through the science program and for each MSB containing a blank
science target, clone it using the supplied coordinate objects.

  @messages = $sp->cloneMSBs( @coords );

Currently can not handle coordinate types that are not RADEC.
Non-RADEC coordinates are ignored silently. Returns an array
of informational messages (no newlines).

There is no corresponding method in the C<OMP::MSB> class because
this method completely reorganizes the MSB layout. An C<OMP::MSB>
objects derived from this class will be broken after cloning
and must be retrieved from the science program object again.

=cut

  my $self = shift;
  my @sources = @_;

  # Remove any targets that are not RADEC
  @sources = grep { $_->type eq 'RADEC'  } @sources;
  return ("No targets supplied for cloning") unless scalar(@sources);

  # Informational messages
  my @info;

  # Loop over each MSB
  my $ncloned = 0;
  for my $msb ($self->msb) {

    # Count the number of useful blank target components
    # Ignoring inheritance

    next unless $blanks > 0;

    push(@info,
         "Number of blank targets in MSB '".$msb->msbtitle.

    # Calculate the max number we can support [as an index]
    my $max = int(($#sources+1) / $blanks) * $blanks - 1;

    # Now loop over the source list
    # It is probably more efficent to generate the XML of the clone
    # and then do all the replacements on the XML before parsing
    # it and inserting it back into the tree. For now, do the
    # long hand approach
    my $nrepeats = 0;
    for (my $i = 0; ($i+$blanks-1) <= $max; $i+= $blanks) {

      # Clone the MSB
      my $clone = $msb->clone();

      # Now replace the targets from the subset of the list
      my $c = $clone->fill_template( coords => [ @sources[$i..($i+$blanks)] ]);

      # Make sure we replaced the correct number
      throw OMP::Error::FatalError("Internal error: We found fewer blank telescope components than expected!!!\n")
        unless $c == $blanks;

      # Insert the clone node in the correct place
      $msb->_tree->parentNode->insertAfter($clone->_tree, $msb->_tree);

      # Keep track of the repeat count for this msb for the error message
      $nrepeats++;

  # MSB objects because they will be pointing to invalid nodes
  if ($ncloned > 0) {
