OMP::TransServer - Sp translator server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OMP::TransServer;

    $odf = OMP::TransServer->translate($xml);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Translation server. Used to convert science program XML to sequences
understandable by the data acquisition systems.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<translate>

Translate the specified Science Program into a form understandable by
the observing system.

    $translation = OMP::TransServer->translate($xml, \%options);

Returns a filename suitable for passing to the queue or the Query Tool,
not the translated configurations themselves.

Only works for JCMT translations. The UKIRT translator is written
in Java and part of the OT software package.

The location of the directory used to write these files can not be
configured via SOAP for security reasons.

Supported options are:

=over 4

=item simulate

Run the translator for simulated configurations

Note that a reference to a hash is used to simplify the SOAP interface.
